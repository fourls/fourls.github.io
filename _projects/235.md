*235* is made in the Unity game engine and written in C#.

*235* is a short educational game that explains the mechanisms of nuclear fission through simple yet satisfying gameplay mechanics. Playing as a single neutron, you have to navigate through a stylised reactor core and interact with different molecules to succeed. These include moderators such as H2O, which slow down your neutron, controls such as boron, which absorb your neutron, and radioactive elements such as non-reactive U-238 and reactive U-235.
