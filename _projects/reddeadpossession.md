*Red Dead Possession* was made in Godot, a 2D/3D game development engine, in three days as part of a self-inflicted coding challenge.

In *Red Dead Possession*, you play as a rogue demon trying to find the perfect human host. As you jump from person to person as you seek one who is worthy of your possession, there may be some collateral damage - but that's just the way things are. Encounter complex puzzles requiring both brainpower and quick reflexes as you learn that not all people are made equal when it comes to their ability to harbour a spirit: the particularly devout may have extra layers of protection, while heathens may not even notice your presence at all.
